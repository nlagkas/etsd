"If your Authority needs to receive data then you must generate a new private/"

"</p>\n"
"<h4>Key pair generation</h4>\n"
"<p>\n"
"To do this, \n"
"go to the <a href='%(public_key_list)s'>Public Key list</a> page and click "
"the \n"
"<a href='%(key_pair_create)s'>New key pair</a> button.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In this form you need to first enter a proper passphrase that will be used "
"to encrypt your private key. Just follow\n"
"the on-screen instructions. Then you have to press the <strong>Generate Key "
"Pair</strong> button to actually generate \n"
"the key pair in your browser. Then you'll see that the <strong>\"Download "
"Private Key\"</strong> button will be enabled\n"
"and you can download the private key using this. The downloaded private key "
"will be encrypted using the passphrase you \n"
"entered so you need both of them. If you miss one of them, you'll need to "

"<h4>Key pair approval </h4>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The key pair you just generated must be approved for usage. To start the "
"approval process you first need to \n"
"<a href='%(privatekey_load)s'>load the private key</a> in your browser. To "

"you that the file has been uploaded. You can the add another file or press "
"the <strong>Return</strong> button to close\n"
"this form and return to the main message screen.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"After you have added the data to the email, you can then press the "

"<h4>Viewing messages</h4>\n"
"<p>\n"
"By visting the  <a href='%(participant_list)s'>Message list</a> page you "

"concern your Authority (either as a sender or a recipient). The messages are "
"by default sorted by their \n"
"status: First the unread (or non-sent), then the read and then the archived "
"messages. You can filter/search \n"
"the messages using the filter in this page. Messages with the same status "
"will be sorted by their sent date.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"You can then click to the blue id button to see the message details. However "
"notice that you will not be \n"

"After you have loaded the correct private key you will be able to donwload "

"When all the data has been downloaded and decrypted the status of the "
"message will be changed to \"Read\". \n"
"A \"Read\" message can be archived by pressing the <strong>Archive</strong> "
"button. An \"archived\" message will just be \n"
"moved to the end of the list of messages. You can also unarchive a message "
"so it will be changed to \"Read\" again.\n"
